# Shell
This is the implementation of a simple shell.
* System commands (may or may not include a pathname) such as 'ls -l' are supported, and it also supports 
background and foreground processes.
* Built-in commands such as 'cd, dir, clr, wait, hist, exit' are supported.
* Pipe operator is supported. However, it doesn't support multiple pipes.

## How to Use It?
* Clone the repo.
* Compile and run.

*** The built-in commands will be explained in wiki later.
